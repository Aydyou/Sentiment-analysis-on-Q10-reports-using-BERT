# Sentiment-analysis-on-Q10-reports-using-BERT

This notebook fine-tunes a Bert based sentiment analyzer. For more details about fine-tuning a classifier based on Bert you can read [this](https://www.curiousily.com/posts/sentiment-analysis-with-bert-and-hugging-face-using-pytorch-and-python/) article. Based on the probabilities of each class (positive, negative, neutral), we assign a score. For training, the following [file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OLO0qG57RZ9qFNtayspi8uQN_ZbMreKE/view?usp=sharing) from Kaggle has been used. The path to files are based on my Colab folder structure, so change them accordingly. After training process the code is written in a way that loads the saved model. You can either download the saved model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dRVbFUK7OPIew2enU0pZD9sp1YlqG_-F/view?usp=sharing) or change the directory path to your saved model after the training. I have plotted the sentiment score vs stock price of 4 companies, the same method should work for any other arbitrary company.
